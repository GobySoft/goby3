 The Goby Underwater Autonomy Project aims to create a unified framework for autonomous marine vehicle collaboration, seamlessly incorporating efficient intervehicle (acoustic, satellite, etc.), flexible interprocess (ethernet, local sockets, etc.), and intuitive interthread (shared pointer) communications. In addition, Goby provides a variety of useful tools for interacting with other marine-related middlewares, as well as marine engineering and oceanographic data.

  \section main_manual Developer manual
  <ul>
  <li> \ref acomms - tackle the extremely rate limited acoustic networking problem. This library was designed with four modules that can operate independently for a developer looking integrate a specific component (e.g. just encoding/decoding) without committing to the entire goby-acomms stack.</li>
  <li> \ref util - provide utility functions for tasks such as logging, scientific calculations, string parsing, and serial device i/o. Goby also relies on the boost libraries <http://www.boost.org/> for many utility tasks to fill in areas where the C++ Standard Library is insufficient or unelegant.</li>
  <li> \ref moos - classes, applications (e.g. pAcommsHandler and iFrontSeat), and functions for interoperating between Goby and the MOOS middleware. </li>
