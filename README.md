# goby project

The Goby Underwater Autonomy Project aims to create a unified framework for multiple scientific autonomous marine vehicle collaboration, seamlessly incorporating acoustic, ethernet, wifi, and serial communications. Goby provides a publish/subscribe middleware that operates on the concept ofunified Nested Communications, with differing layers for interthread, interprocess, and intervehicle communications.

For Release 2.1.1 and newer, Goby uses the standalone DCCL project: https://github.com/GobySoft/dccl

## goby3 middleware

Documentation is still a work in progress. As components get finalized, the goby3-examples repository (https://github.com/GobySoft/goby3-examples) is the best place to see working examples. You may fork this project as a starting point for your own projects using Goby3 so you don't need to configure your own build environment from hand.

Please note that the experimental Goby3 project is a separate fork: https://github.com/GobySoft/goby3
