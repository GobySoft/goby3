Goby Release Notes (Major version 2)

****************
Version 2.1.4

### MOOS

- Added function "register_timer" to GobyMOOSApp to allow for low frequency (<AppTick) register events. Ofter it is usual to do something every 10 sec, every 60 sec, etc. This functionality simplifies doing so.

See https://github.com/GobySoft/goby/compare/2.1.3...2.1.4

****************
Version 2.1.3

This release contains minor bug fixes.

See https://github.com/GobySoft/goby/compare/2.1.2a...2.1.3
****************
Version 2.1.2

### Acomms 

- Improved support for Flexible Data Packet (FDP) in Micro-Modem 2. Now supports both mini-packet and full packets (previously only mini-packets were supported), and an optional application acknowledgment is available that can be used to get acks from FDP messages.
- Added ability to update MicroModem NVRAM configuration while driver is running, rather than just at initialization.
- Added option for MACManager to use a fixed reference (in Unix time) rather than the start of the current day).
- Fix to set RTS line low to avoid garbled messages with the MicroModem2 in Linux.
- (experimental). New `goby_ip_gateway` application: Linux `tun` interface to ease sending of IP/UDP datagrams over Goby.

### PB 

- Added new tool (`goby_hdf5`) for converting Google Protocol Buffers (protobuf) logs into an HDF5 file (https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) suitable for easy data analysis by common scientific tools such as MATLAB, Octave, and Python. This tool is extensible to work on any format log that stores protobuf messages by a plugin interface, where the plugin is responsible for reading and parsing the protobuf log and providing Messages to `goby_hdf5` to process. An example plugin is given in goby/src/test/common/hdf5/test-plugin.cpp. See Github #8.

### Compiling 

- Various improvements to the build system. See Github #12.
  - All compiled objects (binaries, libraries, etc.) are now stored in subdirectories of the ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} (defaults to goby/build when using the build.sh script), and symlinks are created from goby/lib, goby/bin, goby/include, and goby/share to the actual built directories. This makes the out-of-source build more proper, and thus all autogenerated code can by removed by simply removing the contents of ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} (e.g. rm -r goby/build/*)
  - Added support for CMake's install(EXPORT) and export(...) functions that produces a file (goby-config.cmake) that makes it easier for a project dependent on Goby to find the Goby libraries and include the appropriate headers. 

### Bug fixes

Various bug fixes. See https://github.com/GobySoft/goby/compare/2.1.1...2.1.2

****************
Version 2.1.1

= Acomms = 
- DCCL is now its own project separate from Goby: http://libdccl.org. Removed DCCL code and added dependency on libdccl. Left backwards-compatible API in goby/acomms/dccl to allow seamless transition for previous Goby users. One exception: users of Google Protocol Buffers versions prior to 2.5.0 will need to change all DCCL .proto files to import the DCCL extensions .proto instead of the Goby one. That is:
  From:
        import "goby/acomms/protobuf/dccl_option_extensions.proto";
  To:
        import "dccl/protobuf/option_extensions.proto";
- Updated IridiumDriver to handle the Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) protocol in addition to the previously available RUDICS protocol. Removed shore-based components of IridiumDriver (now it is only for the mobile side). Removed dependency on the goby_pb library and so IridiumDriver has moved into the goby_acomms library.
- Removed goby_rudics_shore and added new IridiumShoreDriver to handle all shore-based SBD ("DirectIP") and RUDICS protocol transactions.

= MOOS = 
-  Added failure handling in pAcommsHandler for multiple modems - can try to use one of the listen modems as the new primary modem, or restart the modem with a configurable backoff period. 

= PB =
- Protocol Change! Switched order of group and protobuf name in ZMQ identifier string. Thus, version 2.1 goby_pb is not backwards compatible with 2.0.

*****************
Version 2.0.2

- First stable release of Goby version 2!
- A handful of minor breaking changes from the 2.0.1 release candidates to support a standalone DCCLv3+
  - Reworked Queue messages to not use the .proto files. So no more (goby.field).queue and (goby.msg).queue. Use the goby::acomms::protobuf::QueuedMessageEntry protobuf class instead to configure queues. This makes more sense since different situations may cause differing queueing parameters.
  - Changed (goby.field).dccl to (dccl.field) and (goby.msg).dccl to (dccl.msg)
- Goby Liaison loads all modules using shared libraries instead of having the MOOS components compiled in. This makes it truly generic and extensible.

*****************
Version 2.0.1~rc1

- Release candidate 1: all version 2 functionality complete; documentation still needs to be finished.
- Wire format of DCCL message changed to be little-endian for both body and header (previously header was big-endian and body was little-endian). This release is wire-incompatible with previous betas.
- Added set of CCL messages implemented as subset of DCCL.
- "dccllite" option added for compiling DCCL alone with a minimum of other dependencies within Goby and external.
- Basic router and two drivers added to support "traditional" networking (TCP / UDP) over slow links (predominantly Iridium)

bzr log --line -n0 -r 285..

345: Toby Schneider 2012-05-07 {2.0.1~rc1} added new acomms chapter
344: Toby Schneider 2012-05-04 1. Work on Goby2 user manual: MOOS and Acomms components; 2. Changed TransmissionType enumeration in DriverBase to have DRIVER_SPECIFIC value and removed all MICROMODEM_* values and put them in mm_driver.proto extensions; 3. Added prefix for pAcommsHandler MOOS variables
343: Toby Schneider 2012-05-03 added rounding to legacy CCL encoding for vehicle speed to avoid incorrect values due to truncation
342: Toby Schneider 2012-05-03 Changed DCCLFieldCodecBase::any_size and any_size_repeated to use WireType instead of FieldType to make it the same as encode
341: Toby Schneider 2012-05-03 changed CCL Error message to use bytes codec to avoid default DCCL string 1 byte overhead
340: Toby Schneider 2012-05-01 changed ccl_compatible flag to a selectable enumeration of various identifier codec options (with varint still being the default)
339: Toby Schneider 2012-05-01 added CCL message: MDAT_COMMAND
338: Toby Schneider 2012-05-01 completed implementation of base set of CCL messages: MDAT_EMPTY MDAT_REDIRECT MDAT_BATHY MDAT_CTD MDAT_STATE
337: Toby Schneider 2012-05-01 moved all #include <boost/filesystem.hpp> to .cpp files to avoid bug where including that header brings in a library dependency on boost_system
336: Toby Schneider 2012-04-30 Corrected fix for 64-bit architecture in CCL Lat/Long routine
335: Toby Schneider 2012-04-30 Renamed DCCLDefaultArithmeticFieldCodec to DCCLDefaultNumericFieldCodec to avoid confusion with arithmetic coding (which DCCLDefaultNumericFieldCodec does not do)
334: Toby Schneider 2012-04-30 Nearly finished with CCL State message - cleaned up traversal of message Body and Head for custom embedded messages
333: Toby Schneider 2012-04-30 Started added Legacy CCL as subset of DCCL
332: Toby Schneider 2012-04-27 1. Changed confusing wire format of DCCL where header was big-endian and body was little-endian. Entire message is sent as little-endian now, so header starts at the least significant byte and works upwards. This will break compatibility with prior beta releases of Goby2 but that's why we're still in beta. 2. Started adding CCL compatibility option
331: Toby Schneider 2012-04-26 Much cleaning up in Liaison scope: pause correctly still reads mail in another thread to avoid huge bandwidth and CPU hit when resuming. Made ZeroMQService poll() thread-safe. Added MOOS translator with type name prefix

328: Chris Murphy 2012-04-25 Removing a duplicate include from flex_ostream.h
327: Chris Murphy 2012-04-25 Adding a 'dccllite' option, which builds a minimal DCCL shared library.  The goal is to have it use the minimum required code to support DCCL functionality, and only require linking against protobuf, dccl, and maybe dl or m or the like.  Still tracking down a boost::system dependency, which sneaks in somewhere.
326: Chris Murphy 2012-04-25 Adding an include line for dlfcn, since dccl.cpp calls dlsym.
325: Toby Schneider 2012-04-24 [merge] merge from 2.0-dsop
  321.1.10: Toby Schneider 2012-04-24 in DCCL, replaced boost::dynamic_bitset and get_more_bits signal with custom class based on std::deque<bool>
